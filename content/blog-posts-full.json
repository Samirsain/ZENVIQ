    "content": "<h2>SEO Made Simple</h2><p>Search Engine Optimization often sounds complicated, but in 2025, the best strategies are actually the simplest. Google’s algorithms are smarter than ever, and they prioritize one thing: <strong>Quality User Experience</strong>.</p><h3>1. Focus on 'Search Intent'</h3><p>Don't just target keywords; target answers. Ask yourself, 'What is the user actually looking for?' If your page answers that question clearly, you'll win the ranking game.</p><h3>2. Optimize for Voice Search</h3><p>With AI assistants everywhere, more people are 'asking' questions rather than typing them. Use conversational phrases like 'How do I...' or 'Where is the best...' in your content headers.</p><h3>3. Mobile is Not Optional</h3><p>Every single page must look perfect on a smartphone. A slow-loading or broken mobile site will kill your Google rankings faster than anything else.</p><h3>4. Use High-Quality Visuals</h3><p>Google can now 'see' your images. Ensure they are optimized for speed but also high-quality and relevant to the text.</p><h3>5. Clear and Simple Navigation</h3><p>If a user gets lost on your site, they leave. If they leave, your SEO score drops. Keep your menus simple and your links intuitive.</p><h3>6. Answer FAQs Directly</h3><p>Include a Frequently Asked Questions section. It's a great way to capture featured snippets on Google’s first page.</p><h3>7. Speed is King</h3><p>Every second counts. Use modern formats like WebP for images and ensure your hosting is fast and reliable.</p><p>SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. Start with these 7 tips, and you’ll see your traffic grow steadily throughout 2025.</p>"
